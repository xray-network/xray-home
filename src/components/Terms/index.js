          constitute an account by which the Organization or any other third
          parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of User&apos;s
          ADA or any other cryptocurrency. While the Software has undergone beta
          testing and continues to be improved by feedback from the developers
          community, open-source contributors and beta-testers, the Organization
          cannot guarantee that there will be no bugs in the Software. User

          redemption keys, shielded vending keys, backup recovery mnemonic
          passphrases, ADA passcodes and any other codes User uses to access the
          Software or any information, ADA, voucher, or other cryptocurrency
          unit. IF USER LOSES ACCESS TO USER&apos;S CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET OR
          PRIVATE KEYS AND HAS NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF USER&apos;S
          CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET OR BACKUP RECOVERY MNEMONIC PHRASE(S) AND
          CORRESPONDING PASSWORD(S), USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY ADA
          OR ANY OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES USER HAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT
          CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE. All transaction
          requests are irreversible. The Organization and its shareholders,
          directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents cannot guarantee
          transaction confirmation or retrieve User&apos;s private keys or
          passwords if User loses or forgets them.

          modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under

          rest of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Entire Agreement – Disclaimer of Reliance.</strong> This
          Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
          respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
          agreements or understandings between the Parties. User expressly
          represents and warrants that it is not relying upon any statements,
          understandings, representations, expectations or agreements other than

          User agrees that any and all disputes or claims against any person
          arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or the access,
          use or installation of the Software by User or any other person shall

      </ol>
      <h5>12. Delegation and Staking</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Rewards.</strong> The amount of Rewards a User may earn from
          delegation depends on various factors including, but not limited to,
          user participation, stakepool profit margins and the volume of ada
          being delegated. It is possible that delegation generates no Reward
          for a User due to the above-mentioned factors. Rewards are earned as
          of the start of the 3rd epoch on the Cardano blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delegation.</strong> Users may delegate their stake to one of
          the various stake pools of the Organization or to a third party stake
          pool. User will have the sole right to determine the volume to be
          delegated to a stake pool and may increase or decrease its level of
          participation at any time. Any information Organization shares
          regarding stakepools, including performance metrics and Rewards, will
          be for indicative purposes only and may not be accurate. User does not
          acquire any automatic right to Rewards as a result of delegating its
          stake.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organization Stake-Pools.</strong> The Organization will
          operate various stake pools which will be visible in Ray Network. The
          cost and network and server requirements to reliably operate such
          stake pools shall be determined by the Organization in its sole
          discretion. Organization will communicate the percentage amount of
          Reward to be shared with Users through the User’s Ray Network. Rewards
          will accrue at the end of each epoch and will automatically appear in
          the User’s Ray Network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Redeeming Rewards.</strong> User shall be responsible for
          payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the Rewards might be
          subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to User once
          Rewards are redeemed.
