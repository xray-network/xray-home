        A community-managed treasury opens up a world of infinite possibilities.
        We hope to see a variety of experimentation, including ecosystem grants
        and public goods funding, both of which can foster additional Ray
        Network ecosystem growth. Ray Network has set the standard for automated
        liquidity provision: it is now time to set the benchmark for responsible
        but radical, long-term aligned on-chain governance systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ray Network governance will be live from day one (smart contract release
        date).
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, XRAY holders will have immediate ownership of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ray Network governance</li>
        <li>XRAY community treasury</li>
        <li>The protocol fee switch</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Initial governance parameters are as follows:</p>
      <ul className="mb-5">
        <li>
          1% of XRAY total supply (delegated) to submit a governance proposal
        </li>
        <li>4% of XRAY supply required to vote ’yes’ to reach quorum</li>
        <li>7 day voting period</li>
        <li>2 day timelock delay on execution</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
